# Instance-segmentation-with-MaskRCNN-on-Custom-dataset
In this project, I trained an architecture of convolutional neural network that was published in 2019. This model is well suited for instance and semantic segmentation. There is an option to use pre-trained weights. However, I took a step further and trained my own model using one of 600 classes from the Google Open Images dataset. I chose cat as segmentation object, because i love my cat :).

# Introduction
# Dataset
# What is Image Segmentation
# Mask RCNN


# Results
Some results after running for 1 epoch 

The model has some errors, which is ok because i trained it just for 1 epoch.
